        *1. Create a function that takes two numbers and returns their Multiplication.

        *2. Write a function that prints "Good Morning!" if it's morning (use a parameter), otherwise prints "Good Evening!".

        *3. Create a simple calculator that asks the user to input two numbers. Then, use arithmetic operators to calculate and display the following: Sum ,Difference, Product,Quotient,Remainder.

        *4. Write a program that prompts the user to input their age and checks if the user is eligible to vote. Use comparison operators to compare the age to 18.

        *5.  If the score is greater than or equal to 50, display "You passed!", otherwise display "You failed!" Use the ternary operator for this

                * A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

     * Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure



                                            ? Whate is scope

                        * The scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables.

                        * The scope In JavaScript, scope refers to the current context of your code.



                                    ? What is javascript expressions

                        * 1. A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

                        * 2. A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.

                        * 3. Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.  
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    ? What is javascript operators

* 1. operators are special symbols used in scripts to perform operations on operands, such as arithmetic calculations, logical comparisons, or value assignments.

        * 2. Javascript operators are used to perform different types of mathematical and logical computations
